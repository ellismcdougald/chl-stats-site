# CHL Statistics Website

This is a website that displays player statistics from the Canadian Hockey League. Statistics are available in both totals and rate (per game) form for the 2022-23, 2021-22, and 2020-21 seasons. Please note that Ontario Hockey League statistics are not available for the 2020-21 season as the OHL did not play any games that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The stats can be filtered by serveral factors, including game strength (even-strength, powerplay, shorthanded, and all-situations), season, league, team, position, players, player birthdate range, and minimum games played. The resulting statistics table can also be sorted by any of its columns.

The website is built with NextJS and deployed with Vercel. Statistics are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
